# Bayesian_AB_testing (in development)
Some educational code that walks through the fundamentals of Bayesian A/B testing. 
I run simulations of an experiment and walkthrough the benefits/tradeoffs in terms of both speed and reliability 
of interpreting the results through Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks.
